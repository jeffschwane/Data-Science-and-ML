In this investigation we want to find if there are any natural groups of customers in my dataset.  The first step is to just get the data in a format we can feed to our machine learning models. Once we do that, then our boss (some dude named Gilad), said he will teach us how to cluster the customers! But it turns out you need to have the _data_ formatted in some special way...? Maybe you can tell me about that!"

The first column is titled \"first_name\" and it seems to be the first name of each customer. Is this a usable feature? Well... not exactly in string format. So I guess I could one hot encode them into binary vectors, but even then... do I want to cluster the customers based on their first name? You can imagine some situation where clustering by name might be relevant (for example trying to guess what generation someone belonged to?) but in this case it seems like it's more of a unique identifier so it may be best to simply remove it. If every value in a column is unique (there are no duplications of the value) then we shouldn't use it as a feature because it will have a 1-1 mapping with the target variable which is not something we ever want. We want our model to learn and generalize from the features, not memorize that the name \"jane\" bought 5 cans of soda.\n",
